# socket.io-announce

Lightweight infrastructure broadcast for use with Socket.io RedisStore.

## Install

    npm install socket.io-announce

## Use anywhere in your stack, independent of other socket.io servers.

    var announce = require('socket.io-announce').createClient()
    announce.emit('status', { msg:'Going down for maintaince in 15 minutes', countdown: 15*60*1000 })

## Emit to all users.

    announce.send('Hello, world!')
    announce.emit('quote', { symbol:'APPL', price: 5000 })

## Target socket.io rooms.

    announce.in('boardroom').send('Yoyo yo!')
    announce.in('nodeup').emit('tweet', {
      id: '130749992326533122',
      user:'@dshaw',
      text: 'Keeping things small and tightly focused actually makes solving big problems easier.'
    })

## Target socket.io namespaces (with rooms too).

    var announce = require('socket.io-announce')({ namespace: '/podcast' })
    announce.in('nodeup').emit('episode', {
      url: 'http://www.nodeup.com/twentyfour',
      name: 'NodeUp twentyfour - a secure show'
    })
